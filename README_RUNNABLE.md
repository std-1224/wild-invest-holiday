1. **Main file is `index.html`** - not `index-working-simple.html` or any other file
2. **No build required** - the HTML file is ready to run
3. **Assets must be accessible** - the `public/` folder should be in the same directory
4. **Works offline** - no internet needed after initial load (except for CDN resources)
